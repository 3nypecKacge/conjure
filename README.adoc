== Conversational software development for https://neovim.io[Neovim]

Conjure is an interactive environment for evaluating code and inspecting your program.

The core features of Conjure are language agnostic (although it's targeted at Lisps for now), with each language client providing their own extra tools. Here's the language support so far, unchecked items are planned for the future.

 * [x] https://fennel-lang.org/[Fennel] inside Neovim via Lua and https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed] (which Conjure is written in)
 * [x] https://clojure.org/[Clojure] over https://nrepl.org/[nREPL]
 * [ ] https://clojure.org/[Clojure] over https://oli.me.uk/clojure-socket-prepl-cookbook/[prepl]
 * [ ] https://janet-lang.org/[Janet]
 * [ ] https://racket-lang.org/[Racket]
 * [ ] http://lfe.io/[Lisp Flavoured Erlang]
 * [ ] Scheme (Chicken, Chez or Guile? All?)
 * [ ] Non-Lisp languages and beyond! (when Neovim has tree-sitter)

== Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager, mine is https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[vim-plug] but any will do. Be sure to pin it to a tag and subscribe to releases through GitHub to avoid any surprises in the future.

[source,viml]
----
Plug 'Olical/conjure', {'branch': 'develop'}
----

You'll need to be on the latest stable Neovim for all of the features (such as floating windows) to work. If you see errors, please check your Neovim version before raising an issue.

== Getting started

All further documentation is found within Neovim itself, so hop into `nvim` with Conjure installed and execute `:help conjure` to begin your journey.

== Behind the curtain

Conjure is written entirely in Lua (no VimL or external processes!) which is compiled from https://fennel-lang.org/[Fennel] by https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed] ahead of time. Check out `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` for more on how to work on Conjure using itself, contributions are more than welcome!

Historically, Conjure was Clojure specific with an entirely different implementation, you can still find that version on the https://github.com/Olical/conjure/tree/legacy-jvm[legacy-jvm branch].
