INTRODUCTION                       *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-introduction*

Conjure supports Clojure evaluation over an nREPL connection with optional
CIDER middleware for additional advanced features.

 * https://nrepl.org
 * https://docs.cider.mx/cider-nrepl/

To get started quickly you can start an nREPL server and ensure the port was
written to the `.nrepl-port` file. Once it's running all you need to do is
open a Clojure file and start evaluating forms using |conjure-mappings|.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                               *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-mappings*

These mappings are just the defaults, you can change them as described in
|conjure-mappings| and |conjure-configuration|. You'll also find a few
commands in here, feel free to set up your own project specific mappings that
call out to them.

See |conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-configuration| for specific configuration
options relevant to these mappings.

:ConjureConnect [host] [port]
                         Connect to the given host and port. The host is
                         optional, it'll use
                         `clojure.nrepl/connection.default-host` if you only
                         provide a port number.
                         `:ConjureConnect 5678`
                         `:ConjureConnect staging.my-app.com 5678`

:ConjureShadowSelect [build]
                         Select a shadow-cljs build for further evaluation
                         within this session. Calls through to the
                         `shadow.cljs.devtools.api/nrepl-select` function.
                         `:ConjureShadowSelect my-app`
                         https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs

:ConjurePiggieback [code]
                         Piggieback your current session on top of a
                         ClojureScript evaluation environment. You must
                         provide some code to evaluate that returns a REPL
                         environment. This can be used to connect to
                         figwheel-main or nodejs etc.
                         `:ConjurePiggieback (cljs.repl.node/repl-env)`
                         `:ConjurePiggieback (figwheel.main.api/repl-env "dev")`
                         Calls through to `cider.piggieback/cljs-repl`.
                         https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback

<localleader>cd          Disconnect from the current nREPL server.

<localleader>cf          Connect to a local server using the port found in
                         `.nrepl-port` or `.shadow-cljs/nrepl.port`.

<localleader>ei          Interrupt the oldest evaluation you have running.

<localleader>ve          View the last exception as data.

<localleader>v1          View the most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>v2          View the 2nd most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>v3          View the 3rd most recent evaluation result.

<localleader>vs          View the source of the symbol under the cursor.

<localleader>sc          Clone the current nREPL session.

<localleader>sf          Create a fresh session from scratch.

<localleader>sq          Close the current session.

<localleader>sQ          Close all sessions.

<localleader>sl          List all sessions.

<localleader>sn          Assume the next session in the list.

<localleader>sp          Assume the previous session in the list.

<localleader>ss          Prompt to select any session in the list.

<localleader>st          Display the current session type.
                         Clojure, ClojureScript or Clojure CLR.

<localleader>ta          Run all currently loaded tests.

<localleader>tn          Run all tests within this namespace.

<localleader>tN          Run all tests within the alternate namespace to this
                         one. So if you're in `foo.bar` that would be
                         `foo.bar-test` and if you're in `foo.bar-test` it
                         would be `foo.bar`.

<localleader>tc          Run the specific test under the cursor. You can
                         execute this from anywhere in the form much like
                         evaluating the root form under the cursor.

<localleader>rr          Refresh all changed namespaces.

<localleader>rr          Refresh all namespaces, even unchanged.

<localleader>rc          Clear the namespace refresh cache.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                     *conjure-client-clojure-nrepl-configuration*

All configuration can be set as described in |conjure-configuration|.

`clojure.nrepl/connection.default-host`
            When connecting to `.nrepl-port` files or via `:ConjureConnect`
            this is the default host to use use.
            Default: `"localhost"`

`clojure.nrepl/eval.pretty-print?`
            Should results be pretty printed by the nREPL server.
            Default: `true`
