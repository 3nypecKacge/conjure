INTRODUCTION                                            *conjure-introduction*

Conjure allows you to evaluate code and perform actions in various languages.
The results of your actions are stored in a log buffer that you can view and
edit at any time.

If you don't have the log buffer open the results will be shown temporarily in
the heads up display (HUD), a floating window that vanishes after you move
your cursor. The HUD can be turned off entirely if you would rather check for
results in your own time.

This documentation will show you which mappings are available by default and
how to configure them to suit you. You'll also learn about the extra features
and mappings that are provided by each language specific client.

You can execute `:ConjureSchool` to begin the interactive tutorial which will
introduce you to Conjure's workflow and mappings.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                    *conjure-mappings*

These are the default mappings, |conjure-configuration| will show you how to
remap them to keys that suit you if required. The default prefix key for
almost all of the mappings is `<localleader>` (|maplocalleader|).

If you already have a buffer open and you change a mapping's configuration it
won't update right away. Mappings are defined as you open a buffer, so be sure
to set up your mappings in your Neovim configuration or at least before you
open a buffer.

I've also included some commands since they're related to the mappings.

:ConjureSchool           Start the interactive tutorial which will walk you
                         through the workflow and mappings Conjure provides.

:ConjureEval [code]      Evaluates the given code in the current buffer's
                         language and context. Accepts a range so
                         `:%ConjureEval` would evaluate the entire buffer,
                         this also works with visual selections.


<localleader>ls          Open the log buffer in a new horizontal split window.
                         The direction can be controlled with |splitbelow|.

<localleader>lv          Open the log buffer in a new vertical split window.
                         The direction can be controlled with |splitright|.

<localleader>lt          Open the log buffer in a new tab. Great for viewing
                         large output. Just close the window to close the tab
                         when you're done and return to your previous layout.

<localleader>lq          Close all visible log windows in your current tab.
                         Other tabs will remain unaffected.

<localleader>E           When in visual mode, evaluate the current selection.

<localleader>E[motion]   Evaluate any given motion following this mapping such
                         as <localleader>`E2j` to evaluate this line and the
                         two below it.

<localleader>ee          Evaluate the current form under the cursor. This is
                         the innermost pair (ignoring those in comments or
                         strings). `g:conjure#extract#form_pairs` controls the
                         character pairs.

<localleader>er          Evaluate the root form under the cursor. This is the
                         outermost pair. Great for evaluating a function
                         you're editing if your cursor is within a few nested
                         forms. `g:conjure#extract#form_pairs` controls the
                         character pairs.

<localleader>e!          Evaluate the form under the cursor and replace it
                         with the result of the evaluation. Using this on the
                         form `(+ 10 20)` would replace the form with `30`.

<localleader>em[mark]    Evaluate the form under the cursor at the given
                         |mark|. Set a regular Neovim mark on a form using
                         `mF` for example in any file, then jump to another
                         file. You can evaluate that form at any time with
                         `<localleader>emF`.

<localleader>ew          Evaluate the word under the cursor, good for peeking
                         inside vars defined in your file.

<localleader>ef          Evaluate the current file from disk. This may be
                         different to what's currently in your buffer if you
                         haven't saved!

<localleader>eb          Evaluate the current buffer contents. This may be
                         different to what's on disk if you've edited it
                         without saving.

K                        Look up documentation for the word under the cursor.
                         Support for this may vary between languages.

gd                       Go to the definition of the word under the cursor.
                         Support for this may vary between languages.

Language clients will provide their own extra mappings on top of these, you
can find links to their help in |conjure-clients|.

==============================================================================
COMPLETION                                                *conjure-completion*

Conjure sets the |omnifunc| for all supported languages, the language clients
must implement completion for it to actually provide results. For example,
Fennel has no completion support but Clojure does (assuming your nREPL server
has completion support).

You can get completions through the normal mapping of `<C-x><C-o>`, nothing
else needs to be configured for this to work.

Automatic completion as you type is provided by external plugins. Deoplete
support is built into the Conjure plugin, so if you have Deoplete installed it
should be working already.

 * https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim

Conquerer of Completion support is provided by coc-conjure.

 * https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim
 * https://github.com/jlesquembre/coc-conjure

asyncomplete.vim support is provided by asyncomplete-conjure.vim.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                          *conjure-configuration*

Conjure is configured through global vars such as `g:conjure#debug`, you can
set these with normal VimL `let` expressions. Here's the full list of options
available in the core plugin. Each language client also has its own set of
mappings and settings you can alter.

As an example, we can change the default prefix from `<localleader>` to `,c`
with the following command:
>
    :let g:conjure#mapping#prefix = ",c"

All mappings are prefixed by this by default. To have a mapping work without
the prefix simply wrap the string in a list.
>
    :let g:conjure#mapping#log_split = ["ClS"]

Now you can hit `ClS` without a prefix in any buffer Conjure has a client for.

You can disable a mapping entirely by setting it to `v:false` like so.
>
    :let g:conjure#mapping#doc_word = v:false

These need to be set before you enter a relevant buffer since the mappings are
defined as you enter a buffer and can't be altered after the fact.

`g:conjure#filetype_client.[filetype]`
            Lua module path to use as a client for a filetype. This can be any
            module that adheres to the |conjure-clients| interface.
            Defaults:
             - `g:conjure#filetype_client.fennel = "conjure.client.fennel.aniseed"`
             - `g:conjure#filetype_client.clojure = "conjure.client.clojure.nrepl"`
             - `g:conjure#filetype_client.janet = "conjure.client.janet.netrepl"`

`g:conjure#eval#result_register`
            Every evaluation captures the result and places it in a Neovim
            register for you to use however you want. By default, if you
            evaluate a form, you can then hit `"cp` to paste the result into
            your buffer or `<C-r>c` in insert mode. Some suggestions of other
            registers you can set this to:
             * `"\""` or `"*"` the default register for easy access.
             * `"C"` if you want to keep your lower case registers clear.
             * `"_"` the black hole when you don't want this at all.
            Default: `"c"`

`g:conjure#eval#relative_file_root`
            When evaluating the current file Conjure will attempt to resolve
            the absolute file path to a relative path based on the current
            working directory of Neovim by default. This means you can
            evaluate files on other machines or inside Docker containers that
            share a common file structure for the project but may be stored in
            different parts of the overall file system.
            You can set this option to handle a different Neovim working
            directory to your connected runtime's working directory.
            `:let g:conjure#eval#relative_file_root = getcwd() . "/sub-proj"`
            Default: `undefined` (current working directory)

`g:conjure#eval#always_absolute_file`
            When true, disable the relative resolving functionality controlled
            by `g:conjure#eval#relative_file_root` entirely. Always use the
            full absolute path when evaluating the current file.
            Default: `false`

`g:conjure#mapping#prefix`
            The key that proceeds most mappings.
            Default: `"<localleader>"`

`g:conjure#mapping#log_split`
            Opens the log in a horizontal split.
            Default: `"ls"`

`g:conjure#mapping#log_vsplit`
            Opens the log in a vertical split.
            Default: `"lv"`

`g:conjure#mapping#log_tab`

            Default: `"lt"`

`g:conjure#mapping#log_close_visible`
            Close all visible log windows.
            Default: `"lq"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_current_form`
            Evaluates the form under the cursor.
            Default: `"ee"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_root_form`
            Evaluates the root form under the cursor.
            Default: `"er"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_replace_form`
            Evaluates the form under the cursor and replace with the result.
            Default: `"e!"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_marked_form`
            Evaluates the form at the marks location.
            Default: `"em"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_word`
            Evaluates the word under the cursor.
            Default: `"ew"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_file`
            Evaluates the file from disk.
            Default: `"ef"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_buf`
            Evaluates the buffer from memory.
            Default: `"eb"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_visual`
            Evaluates the visual selection.
            Default: `"E"`

`g:conjure#mapping#eval_motion`
            Evaluates the following motion.
            Default: `"E"`

`g:conjure#mapping#doc_word`
            Looks up documentation for the word under the cursor.
            Default: `["K"]`

`g:conjure#mapping#def_word`
            Goes to the definition of the word under the cursor.
            Default: `["gd"]`

`g:conjure#log#hud#width`
            Width of the HUD as a percentage of the editor width.
            A float between 0.0 and 1.0.
            Default: `0.42`

`g:conjure#log#hud#height`
            Height of the HUD as a percentage of the editor height.
            A float between 0.0 and 1.0.
            Default: `0.3`

`g:conjure#log#hud#enabled`
            Should the HUD be displayed at all.
            Default: `true`

`g:conjure#log#hud#passive_close_delay`
            Delay to introduce (in milliseconds) when closing the HUD
            passively such as after you move the cursor. Set it to `0` to
            disable the mechanic entirely and close instantly.
            Default: `0`

`g:conjure#log#botright`
            Force the log to always open at the bottom or far right of the
            editor, taking up the full width or height respectively.
            Default: `false`

`g:conjure#log#break_length`
            Length of the break comment (`; ---------...`) between log results
            in characters. Used in trimming to avoid cutting forms in half.
            Default: `80`

`g:conjure#log#trim#at`
            Trim the log once the line count passes the value.
            Default: `10000`

`g:conjure#log#trim#to`
            Trim the log down to this many lines when it gets too long.
            Default: `7000`

`g:conjure#log#strip_ansi_escape_sequences_line_limit`
            If the chunk of text being appended to the log is less than this
            many lines in length, strip all ANSI escape sequences from it. If
            you set this to `0` it'll never apply, you can then use an ANSI
            escape sequence highlight plugin to display the colours in the
            buffer.
            A line limit is used to prevent massive output (which probably
            doesn't contain escape sequences) from slowing down your log.
            Default: `100`

`g:conjure#extract#context_header_lines`
            How many lines of the file should be checked for a context
            (namespace name) such as `(module foo.bar)` or `(ns foo.bar)`
            which is used for setting the right context for evaluations.
            If you have buffers with huge comment headers you may want to set
            this higher.
            If a specific buffer isn't extracting the context correctly, you
            can override it by setting `b:conjure#context`.
            Default: `24`

`g:conjure#extract#form_pairs`
            Character pairs to search for when evaluating forms. The closest
            matching pair is used when evaluating the current form but the
            furthest matching pair is used for root forms.
            The structure of each item is `[start end escape?]` where the
            first two are characters and the third is an optional boolean to
            enable escaping for use in |searchpairpos()|.
            Default: `[["(" ")"] ["{" "}"] ["[" "]" true]]`

`g:conjure#preview#sample_limit`
            Most evaluation actions create a line in the log buffer with a
            preview of the code that was evaluated as a reminder. This setting
            controls how long that preview should be before it trails off into
            ellipsis. It is a percentage value based on the width of the
            editor. This is so you can align it with the width of your HUD.
            A float between 0.0 and 1.0.
            Default: `0.3`

`g:conjure#debug`
            Display debug information in any client you're using.
            Default: `false`

`b:conjure#context`
            Override the context name for a specific buffer, preventing
            Conjure from attempting to extract it from the first few lines
            defined by the `g:conjure#extract#context_header_lines`
            configuration value.
            Default: `undefined`

==============================================================================
LOG                                                              *conjure-log*

The log buffer is a regular buffer that you can edit and interact with as you
normally would. You can even insert new code and evaluate it, seeing the
results at the bottom of the buffer, kind of like a regular REPL.

The log buffer will scroll along with new results if you leave your cursor on
the last line, like a terminal following along with new output.

If you'd like to stop it scrolling and just see a specific result for a while
you can move your cursor to it. Conjure will then leave that cursor where it
is, it'll only follow along if left on the last line of the buffer. To
continue following new output you can press `G` to go to the bottom.

If a result is appended to the end of the log and you don't currently have a
log on your screen with the cursor following along, the HUD will
appear (unless you've disabled it through config). This is to ensure you
always see new entries, even if you're looking at something further up in the
log.

The HUD is a floating window that shows you the current tail of the log. It
tries to show you the top of extremely large results since the top of a data
structure tends to be more interesting than the bottom. It'll vanish when you
move the cursor and can be turned off entirely through configuration.

The log will be automatically trimmed when it gets too long, this can be
tweaked with configuration. It will attempt to trim to a known good break
point so as to not cut a large data structure or string in half resulting in
broken highlighting in the rest of the log buffer.

Note: The HUD may be unreadable if your theme defines odd colours for the
`Pmenu` highlight group. You can set a different background colour by theming
`NormalFloat` or `Pmenu` with something like the following.

==============================================================================
CLIENTS                                                      *conjure-clients*

Conjure comes bundled with a set of built in clients, you can access their
documentation below or through the `:help conjure-client-*` command. You can
install more clients through 3rd party plugins or simply write your own within
your dotfiles.

 - |conjure-client-fennel-aniseed|
 - |conjure-client-clojure-nrepl|
 - |conjure-client-janet-netrepl|

Language clients are simply Lua modules (which can be compiled from Fennel
using Aniseed) that have a few essential properties and functions in them.

The module doesn't have to be within Conjure's source tree, it can be inside a
3rd party plugin repository, you just connect a filetype to it with the
`g:conjure#filetype_client.[filetype]` configuration option.

When implementing a new language client you'll need to provide the following
values and functions at the top level of your module. You can split your
client up into separate modules and just build this API into your init module.
See `fnl/conjure/client/clojure/nrepl/init.fnl` for an example of this.

`buf-suffix`
            String
            Last part of the log buffer name which helps with setting the
            filetype among other things depending on what plugins a user may
            have installed. For example, Fennel's is `".fnl"` and Clojure's is
            `".cljc"`. Whatever suits your language, it's up to you!

`context-pattern`
            String
            Lua pattern to identify the module or namespace name from the
            first few lines of the buffer. Used to set the context for each
            user evaluation. Clojure's is `%(%s*ns%s*(.-)[%s){]`, alter as you
            see fit for your language. The value in the first capture group is
            passed into later functions as `opts.context`.
            If this doesn't suit your needs, leave it `nil` and define a
            `context` function instead.

`context`
            Function
            Called instead of `context-pattern` if it's not defined. Is passed
            the first few lines of the buffer as it's only argument. You can
            parse out the context string in any way you see fit.
            The return value is passed into later functions as `opts.context`.

`comment-prefix`
            String
            Proceeds lines that describe what kind of evaluation has taken
            place (among other things), you don't want those to be highlighted
            as code so they're turned into comments by placing this string
            before them. For Lisps you probably want to use `"; "`, notice the
            trailing space!

`eval-str`
            Function(opts)
            Takes a single argument table `opts` which contains the following:
             - `opts.code`
                 String to be embedded in your evaluation. You can wrap it
                 with whatever padding code you require. This is what the user
                 selected for evaluation.
             - `opts.context`
                 String extracted using `context-pattern` or `nil` if nothing
                 could be found. At that point you should default it to
                 something sensible or not set the context of your evaluation
                 at all.
             - `opts.action`
                 Always `"eval"` in this case.
             - `opts.file-path`
                 Path to the buffer the user is evaluating from.
             - `opts.origin`
                 What the evaluation originated from such as `"current-form"`.
             - `opts.preview`
                 A comment that's appended to the log for you describing what
                 action the user just took for future reference. It lends
                 context to your follow up log entries with results.
             - `opts.range`
                 Contains `start` and `end` tuples that mark the starting and
                 ending row and column for the code that was extracted from
                 the buffer.
             - `opts.on-result`
                 An optional function, when it's present you should call it
                 with the result of the evaluation as a string. This is used
                 when evaluating code and replacing it in the buffer it came
                 from. Such as evaluating `(+ 10 20)` and replacing the
                 original form with `30`.

`doc-str`
            Function(opts)
            Almost identical to `eval-str` even down to taking the same
            arguments. Instead of just evaluating `opts.code` though it should
            wrap it in whatever code necessary to produce documentation output
            for the given code. `opts.code` will probably be a single keyword.
            In the case of Clojure it's wrapped in `(doc ...)`, if your
            language doesn't implement documentation lookup you can skip this
            function or have it print a warning. The Clojure implementation
            actually leans on it's own `eval-str`.

`def-str`
            Function(opts)
            Similar to `doc-str` but it should jump the user to the definition
            of the value in `opts.code` using the `conjure.editor/go-to`
            function (or similar, it's up to you how you implement it).
            If your language doesn't support looking up definitions you can
            leave the function out or print a warning.

`completions`
            Function(opts)
            Called with a single argument table called `opts`, containing the
            following values.
             - `opts.prefix`
                 The string you should be completing for the user.
             - `opts.cb`
                 A callback function to be invoked with the results.
                 Completion results should conform to what
                 |complete-functions| return in a normal |omnifunc|.
             - `opts.context`
                 Same as the context in `eval-str`, can be used to calculate
                 completions based on the file the user is working on.
            If you don't provide this function all completion attempts will
            work, they'll just default to returning no results, it shouldn't
            produce errors or warnings.
            Asynchronous completion plugins that have Conjure support will
            call this function, so you'll get automatic completions as you
            type right away.

`eval-file`
            Function(opts)
            Again, similar to `eval-str`, you should just perform an
            appropriate evaluation (maybe using your own `eval-str`) to load
            `opts.file-path` from disk, however that should be done in your
            language.

`on-filetype`
            Function()
            Called when the filetype your client is associated with is opened.
            This is the time for you to set up your own mappings and buffer
            local commands using the `conjure.mapping` module where required.
            You can create your own mappings based on your own configuration,
            just like the Fennel + Aniseed module. It's called every time a
            file associated with your client is opened.

`on-load`
            Function()
            Much like `on-filetype` but it's only called as the client is
            loaded for the first time. You can use this to register
            autocommands or perform one off actions the first time a user
            opens a file of a relevant filetype. In the case of Clojure, this
            is when it attempts to connect to a `.nrepl-port` file and hooks
            up an autocommand to clean up any existing nREPL connection before
            Neovim exits.
